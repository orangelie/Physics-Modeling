üòÄ Hello, everyone.  üòÄ  
This repository is a cmake project about physical engine, physical simulation, and physical rendering based on **directx9, directx11, directx12 and unity3d**.
***Please understand that my skills regarding cmake are poor. :D***  
  
I am a student who is interested in  
**game programming** and **graphics technology**.  
I am trying to achieve my dream mainly in game graphics,  
and my favorite hobbies are **health training** and **programming**.  
 üíñ  Thank you ! üíñ

## ‚≠ê Recommendations from this repository ‚≠ê
[Dx12PhysicsSimulations](https://github.com/orangelie/Physics-Modeling/tree/main/PhysicsModelingDX12/VSSolution): The project is based on its own DirectX12-based engine. This project includes several useful examples for physical simulators. If there is anything to note, it is not a cmake project, so please slightly modify the C++ library reference part in the project setting.  
  
[Unity3DSimulations](https://github.com/orangelie/Physics-Modeling/tree/main/Unity3D): This project is based on Unity Engine. This project includes some useful examples for physical simulators. The code is highly toxic, so please refer to it.
